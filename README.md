# Twitchlite

A lightweight livestream indexer for twitch. Just add your client_id to the functions.php file and it's good to go.

Default limit is 25 livestreams sorted after the most popular. Limit can go up to 100 and the offset can be used to look through less popular channels.

You can also choose livestreams plasying a specific game, and it pulls the 10 most popular for autocompletion.

For more info on the options and how to get a client_id check out the twitch API docs.
